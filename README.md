# Face-Detection-Using-Haar-Cascade

Face detection using python OpenCV with Haar Cascade. 
Haar Cascade is an Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image or a real time video. The algorithm uses edge or line detection features proposed by Viola and Jones in their research paper “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” published in 2001. The algorithm is given a lot of positive images consisting of faces, and a lot of negative images not consisting of any face to train on them.

## About

* Detects Face in the frame and draw blue circle around the face in real time with the help of web camera.\
* Also counts the number of faces present in the frame.
* Counts the Frame Per Second (FPS) as well.
